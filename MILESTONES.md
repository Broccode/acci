## Questions to Clarify

1. Are there specific MVP features that should be prioritized?
2. What are the minimal security requirements for the MVP?
3. Are there existing systems to integrate with in the MVP phase?
4. What are the basic performance requirements for the MVP?

## Notes

- All milestones follow best practices from `.cursorrules`
- Each milestone requires complete documentation
- Code reviews are mandatory
- Automated tests are required
- Regular security audits
- Continuous performance monitoring
- For each completed milestone step:
  - Developer documentation must be added to `/docs/{lang}` in all supported languages (EN, DE, SQ)
  - Documentation must follow the established structure and terminology
  - Documentation must be reviewed and approved before milestone completion
  - Documentation must include:
    - Technical architecture details
    - Implementation decisions
    - API documentation if applicable
    - Configuration guidelines
    - Troubleshooting guides
    - Code examples
    - Performance considerations
    - Security implications

## Documentation Strategy

### Structure

Each milestone's documentation will be organized in the following directories:

- `/docs/en/` - English documentation (primary)
- `/docs/de/` - German documentation
- `/docs/sq/` - Albanian documentation

### Documentation Requirements

1. All milestone documentation must be:
   - Written in clear, technical language
   - Consistent across all supported languages
   - Version controlled
   - Reviewed by technical and language experts
   - Updated with each milestone iteration
   - Cross-referenced with related documentation
   - Searchable and well-structured

2. Documentation Format:
   - Markdown files for general documentation
   - OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
   - Mermaid diagrams for visual representations
   - Code examples with syntax highlighting
   - Step-by-step guides where applicable

3. Quality Assurance:
   - Technical review of primary (English) documentation
   - Translation review by native speakers
   - Consistency check across all languages
   - Validation of technical accuracy
   - Verification of completeness

## Testing Strategy

### Test Organization

1. Unit Tests:
   - Located inline with the source code
   - Fast execution for quick feedback
   - Run by default with `cargo test`
   - Focus on single components/functions
   - Mock external dependencies

2. Integration Tests:
   - Separate test directory (`tests/`)
   - Must use testcontainers-rs framework for container-based tests
   - Excluded from default test run to avoid delays
   - Run with `cargo test --test '*'`
   - Test real interactions between components
   - Test database interactions
   - Test external service integrations

### Test Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── api/              # API integration tests
├── database/         # Database integration tests
├── e2e/             # End-to-end tests
├── fixtures/         # Test fixtures and data
├── helpers/         # Test helper functions
└── services/        # Service integration tests
```

Each test directory should contain:

- `mod.rs` - Module declarations and common utilities
- `*_test.rs` - Actual test files
- `common/` - Shared test utilities for that specific test category

### Integration Test Guidelines

1. File Naming:
   - Test files must end with `_test.rs`
   - Names should clearly indicate the tested component
   - Example: `user_service_test.rs`, `auth_api_test.rs`

2. Test Organization:
   - One test file per component/service
   - Clear test categories using test modules
   - Shared setup in `mod.rs`
   - Common utilities in `helpers/`

3. Container Management:
   - Container lifecycle in `helpers/containers.rs`
   - Reuse containers where possible
   - Proper cleanup in `Drop` implementations
   - Version-pinned images in constants

### Test Requirements

1. Test Structure:
   - Clear separation between unit and integration tests
   - Proper test naming convention
   - Descriptive test cases
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Performance considerations for test execution

2. Container-based Testing:
   - Use testcontainers-rs for all container-dependent tests
   - Proper cleanup after test execution
   - Isolated test environments
   - Version-pinned container images
   - Configurable container settings

3. Test Quality:
   - No flaky tests allowed
   - Proper error messages
   - Comprehensive assertions
   - Clean test data management
   - Proper mocking of external services

4. CI/CD Integration:
   - Separate pipeline stages for unit and integration tests
   - Proper caching of test containers
   - Parallel test execution where possible
   - Test result reporting
   - Coverage reporting

## MVP Success Criteria

1. Test user can log in through the UI
2. Successful login redirects to a simple success page
3. Basic error handling works
4. Simple deployment works
5. Basic documentation exists
