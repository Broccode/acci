### M1.2: MVP Backend (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Basic Axum setup
  - Health check endpoint
  - Basic error handling
- [ ] Database integration
  - PostgreSQL setup
  - Simple user table
- [ ] Simple authentication
  - Basic login endpoint
  - Hardcoded test user

## Questions to Clarify

1. Are there specific MVP features that should be prioritized?
2. What are the minimal security requirements for the MVP?
3. Are there existing systems to integrate with in the MVP phase?
4. What are the basic performance requirements for the MVP?

## Notes

- All milestones follow best practices from `.cursorrules`
- Each milestone requires complete documentation
- Code reviews are mandatory
- Automated tests are required
- Regular security audits
- Continuous performance monitoring

## MVP Success Criteria

1. Test user can log in through the UI
2. Successful login redirects to a simple success page
3. Basic error handling works
4. Simple deployment works
5. Basic documentation exists
