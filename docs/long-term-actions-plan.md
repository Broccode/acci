## Action Items

### 1. Complete Test Strategy Integration

#### Quarter 1: Integration and Optimization

1. Test Suite Organization

   ```rust
   // In tests/src/lib.rs
   pub mod unit {
       pub mod auth;
       pub mod api;
       pub mod db;
   }
   
   pub mod integration {
       pub mod workflows;
       pub mod security;
       pub mod performance;
   }
   
   pub mod property {
       pub mod auth_properties;
       pub mod api_properties;
       pub mod security_properties;
   }
   
   pub mod mutation {
       pub mod auth_mutations;
       pub mod api_mutations;
       pub mod security_mutations;
   }
   ```

2. Test Runner Configuration

   ```toml
   # .cargo/config.toml
   [test]
   # Parallel test execution
   test-threads = 8
   
   # Test organization
   test-groups = [
       "unit",
       "integration",
       "property",
       "mutation"
   ]
   
   # Test filtering
   test-filters = [
       "auth::",
       "api::",
       "security::"
   ]
   ```

#### Quarter 2: Automation and CI/CD

       - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Daily full test run
   
   jobs:
     test-matrix:
       strategy:
         matrix:
           test-group: [unit, integration, property, mutation]
           rust-version: [stable, beta]
           os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
       
       runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
