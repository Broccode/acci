  - Integration test scenarios
  - Authentication flow validation

## Technical Details

### Authentication Provider System

The authentication system is built on a provider-based architecture that allows for:

- Easy addition of new authentication methods
- Clear separation between authentication logic and business logic
- Testable and maintainable code structure

### Password Security

- Utilizes Argon2 for state-of-the-art password hashing
- Implements best practices for password storage and verification
- Configurable parameters for memory, iterations, and parallelism

### JWT Implementation

- Standard-compliant JWT token generation
- Secure signing with configurable keys
- Built-in token validation and verification

## Next Steps

1. Complete the login endpoint implementation
2. Set up test user infrastructure
3. Implement integration tests for authentication flow
4. Add API documentation for authentication endpoints
