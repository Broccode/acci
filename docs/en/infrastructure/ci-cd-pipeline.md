# CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and provides automated testing, building, and deployment processes. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments.

## Pipeline Structure

### CI Pipeline (On Pull Request)

1. Code Quality Checks
   - Rust formatting check
   - Clippy linting
   - Dependency audit
   - SBOM generation and verification

2. Testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Coverage reporting

3. Security Checks
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secret scanning
   - License compliance check
   - Container image scanning

### CD Pipeline (On Main Branch)

1. Build Process
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Artifact generation
   - Documentation generation
   - Version tagging

2. Deployment Stages
   - Development environment
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment
   - Documentation deployment

## Key Features

### Automated Testing

- Parallel test execution
- Test result reporting
- Coverage tracking
- Performance regression testing

### Security Measures

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SBOM generation (CycloneDX)
- Container security scanning
- Secret detection

### Quality Assurance

- Code style enforcement
- Static analysis
- Documentation validation
- API compatibility checks

## Configuration Files

Key configuration files for the pipeline:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline definition
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - CD pipeline definition
- `.github/workflows/docs-sync.yml` - Documentation synchronization
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release process

## Best Practices

1. All changes must go through PR process
2. PRs require passing CI checks
3. Main branch is protected
4. Releases follow semantic versioning
5. Documentation is kept in sync

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Pipeline execution time tracking
- Test coverage metrics
- Security scan results
- Deployment success rates

## Emergency Procedures

1. Pipeline failure handling
2. Rollback procedures
3. Emergency fixes
4. Security incident response
