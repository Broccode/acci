# CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and provides automated testing, building, and deployment processes. The pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments.

## Pipeline Structure

### CI Pipeline (On Pull Request)

1. Code Quality Checks
   - Rust formatting check using `rustfmt`
   - Clippy linting with custom rules
   - Dependency audit using `cargo-deny`
   - SBOM generation and verification with CycloneDX
   - EditorConfig validation
   - Markdown linting

2. Testing
   - Unit tests with cargo test
   - Integration tests with test containers
   - End-to-end tests with proper setup
   - Coverage reporting using cargo-tarpaulin
   - Performance benchmarks using criterion
   - API contract testing

3. Security Checks
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secret scanning with custom patterns
   - License compliance check using cargo-deny
   - Container image scanning with Trivy
   - SAST analysis
   - Security headers verification

### CD Pipeline (On Main Branch)

1. Build Process
   - Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal images
   - Artifact generation and versioning
   - Documentation generation with rustdoc
   - Version tagging following SemVer
   - SBOM attachment to releases
   - Changelog validation

2. Deployment Stages
   - Development environment deployment
   - Staging environment validation
   - Production environment rollout
   - Documentation deployment to GitHub Pages
   - Health check verification
   - Metrics setup verification

## Key Features

### Automated Testing

- Parallel test execution for speed
- Test result reporting with detailed logs
- Coverage tracking with minimum thresholds
- Performance regression testing
- Database migration testing
- API compatibility verification
- Load testing for critical endpoints

### Security Measures

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SBOM generation (CycloneDX format)
- Container security scanning
- Secret detection and prevention
- Security headers validation
- SSL/TLS configuration checks
- Access token rotation
- Audit logging

### Quality Assurance

- Code style enforcement
- Static analysis with multiple tools
- Documentation validation and sync
- API compatibility checks
- Performance benchmarking
- Error handling verification
- Resource leak detection
- Dead code elimination

## Configuration Files

Key configuration files for the pipeline:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline definition
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - CD pipeline definition
- `.github/workflows/docs-sync.yml` - Documentation synchronization
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release process
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security scanning
- `.github/workflows/dependabot.yml` - Dependency updates

## Best Practices

1. All changes must go through PR process
2. PRs require passing CI checks
3. Main branch is protected
4. Releases follow semantic versioning
5. Documentation is kept in sync
6. Security issues are prioritized
7. Performance regressions block merges
8. Test coverage must meet thresholds
9. CHANGELOG.md must be updated
10. Version bumps follow guidelines

## Monitoring and Metrics

- Pipeline execution time tracking
- Test coverage metrics
- Security scan results
- Deployment success rates

   - Failure analysis tools
   - Quick rollback capability
   - Emergency contact list

2. Rollback Procedures
   - Automated rollback triggers
   - Data integrity verification
   - Service health validation
   - User notification system

3. Emergency Fixes
   - Hotfix branch process
   - Emergency review protocol
   - Quick deployment pipeline
   - Validation requirements

4. Security Incident Response
   - Incident classification
   - Response team activation
   - Communication protocols
   - Recovery procedures
