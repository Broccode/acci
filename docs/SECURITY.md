## Password Security

### Password Requirements

All passwords in the system must meet the following requirements:

- Minimum length: 8 characters
- Maximum length: 128 characters
- Must contain at least:
  - One uppercase letter
  - One lowercase letter
  - One number
  - One special character

### Password Hashing

Passwords are hashed using the Argon2id algorithm with the following secure parameters:

- Algorithm: Argon2id
- Version: 0x13 (19)
- Memory cost: 64 MB (65536 KiB)
- Time cost: 2 iterations
- Parallelism: 1 thread
- Output length: 32 bytes
- Salt: Randomly generated for each hash

These parameters are chosen based on OWASP recommendations and provide a good balance between security and performance.

### Implementation Details

- All password operations use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Salts are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- Passwords are never logged or stored in plain text
- All password-related errors return generic messages to prevent information leakage

### Password Change and Reset

- Password changes require the current password
- Password resets generate secure, time-limited tokens
- New passwords must meet all complexity requirements
- Previous passwords cannot be reused
