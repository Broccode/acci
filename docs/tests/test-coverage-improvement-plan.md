# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for improving test coverage across the ACCI project, with a focus on critical components and security-relevant code paths.

## Current Status

Based on the latest coverage analysis:

- **acci-api**: Good coverage of health endpoints and error handling
- **acci-core**: Basic coverage of version and error handling
- **acci-db**: Solid coverage of database operations
- **acci-auth**: No dedicated tests (critical)
- **acci-frontend**: No dedicated tests
- **CLI Tools**: No direct tests

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Security Components (Weeks 1-2)

#### 1.1 Authentication Module Tests (`acci-auth`)

```rust
// Example test structure for acci-auth
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_token_generation() {
        // Test token generation with valid credentials
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_token_validation() {
        // Test token validation with various scenarios
    }
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_token_expiration() {
        // Test token expiration handling
    }
}
```

Tasks:

- Implement basic authentication flow tests
- Add token lifecycle tests
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Implement session management tests
- Add concurrent access tests

#### 1.2 Database Security Tests

Tasks:

- Add SQL injection prevention tests
- Test connection pool security
- Implement transaction isolation tests
- Add concurrent access tests
- Test error propagation

### Phase 2: CLI Tools and Infrastructure (Weeks 3-4)

#### 2.1 Database CLI Tools

Tasks:

- Add tests for `test_users` binary
- Implement `hash_passwords` binary tests
- Test database migration tools
- Add error handling tests
- Test configuration validation

#### 2.2 Infrastructure Tests

Tasks:

- Implement configuration loading tests
- Add logging setup tests
- Test metrics collection
- Implement tracing setup tests
- Add health check tests

### Phase 3: Frontend and Integration (Weeks 5-6)

#### 3.1 Frontend Component Tests

Tasks:

- Set up frontend testing framework
- Add component render tests
- Implement state management tests
- Test API integration
- Add error handling tests

#### 3.2 End-to-End Integration Tests

Tasks:

- Implement full authentication flow tests
- Add user management flow tests
- Test configuration management
- Add performance tests
- Implement security flow tests

## Test Quality Improvements

### 1. Property-Based Testing

Add property-based tests for complex logic:

```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_token_validation(
        user_id in any::<i32>(),
        expiry in 1..10000i64
    ) {
        // Test token validation with various inputs
    }
}
```

### 2. Mutation Testing

Implement mutation testing:

```bash
cargo install cargo-mutants
cargo mutants
```

### 3. Coverage Goals

Set minimum coverage requirements:

- Critical paths: 95%
- Core functionality: 90%
- General code: 80%

## CI/CD Integration

### 1. Coverage Tracking

Add to CI pipeline:

```yaml
jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run coverage
        run: |
          make coverage
          make coverage-html
      - name: Check coverage thresholds
        run: |
          ./scripts/check-coverage-thresholds.sh
```

### 2. Automated Reporting

Implement automated coverage reporting:

```rust
// In tests/src/lib.rs
#[test]
fn generate_coverage_report() {
    // Generate detailed coverage report
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Security-Critical Tests

Focus areas:

- Authentication flows
- Authorization checks
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Session management

### 2. Security Test Patterns

Example security test pattern:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_authentication_security() {
    // Test against common security vulnerabilities
    test_brute_force_protection().await;
    test_session_fixation().await;
    test_token_replay().await;
}
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### 1. Coverage Metrics

Track:

- Overall coverage percentage
- Coverage by component
- Critical path coverage
- Branch coverage
- Function coverage

### 2. Test Quality Metrics

Monitor:

- Test execution time
- Test reliability
- Coverage trends
- Security test coverage
- Integration test coverage

## Documentation

### 1. Test Documentation

Requirements:

- Clear test descriptions
- Coverage reports
- Security considerations
- Test patterns
- Best practices

### 2. Maintenance

Regular tasks:

- Update test documentation
- Review coverage reports
- Adjust coverage goals
