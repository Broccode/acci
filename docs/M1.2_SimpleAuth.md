### In Progress

- Login Endpoint Implementation
  - REST API endpoint for user authentication

  - Token-based response
- Test User Setup
  - Development test user configuration
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Authentication flow validation

## Technical Details

### Authentication Provider System

The authentication system is built on a provider-based architecture that allows for:

- Easy addition of new authentication methods
- Clear separation between authentication logic and business logic
- Testable and maintainable code structure

### Password Security

- Utilizes Argon2 for state-of-the-art password hashing
- Implements best practices for password storage and verification
- Configurable parameters for memory, iterations, and parallelism

### JWT Implementation

- Standard-compliant JWT token generation
- Secure signing with configurable keys
- Built-in token validation and verification

## Next Steps

1. Complete the login endpoint implementation
2. Set up test user infrastructure
3. Implement integration tests for authentication flow
4. Add API documentation for authentication endpoints

## Test Users

### Overview

The system provides predefined test users for development and testing environments. These users are automatically created during database migrations and can be used to test the authentication system without the need to create new users manually.

### Configuration

Test users are configured in `acci-core::auth::TestUserConfig` and are only enabled in debug builds. The configuration includes:

- Enabled/disabled flag (automatically set based on build configuration)
- List of predefined users with:
  - Email address
  - Password (clear text for testing)
  - Full name
  - Role

### Default Test Users

Two default test users are provided:

1. Admin User
   - Email: <test.admin@example.com>
   - Password: test123!admin
   - Role: admin

2. Regular User
   - Email: <test.user@example.com>
   - Password: test123!user
   - Role: user

### Security Considerations

- Test users are only available in debug builds (`cfg(debug_assertions)`)
- Test users are only created in development and test environments
- The database migration checks the environment before creating test users
- Passwords are properly hashed in the database
- Clear text passwords are only available in the configuration for testing purposes

### Usage in Tests

Test users can be used in integration tests:

```rust
let test_config = TestUserConfig::default();
let credentials = Credentials {
    username: test_config.users[0].email.clone(), // Admin user
    password: test_config.users[0].password.clone(),
};

let result = auth_provider.authenticate(credentials).await?;
assert!(result.is_ok());
```

### Implementation Details

1. Configuration (`acci-core/src/auth.rs`)
   - TestUserConfig struct with enabled flag and user list
   - Default implementation providing standard test users
   - Build configuration awareness

2. Database Migration
   - Conditional creation based on environment
   - Secure password hashing
   - Idempotent operation with conflict handling

3. Authentication Provider
   - Test user check before database lookup
   - Direct password comparison for test users
   - Proper session and token generation

### Testing

The test user functionality is covered by comprehensive tests:

1. Authentication Tests
   - Successful authentication for both user types
   - Invalid password handling
   - Release mode deactivation

2. Database Tests
   - User existence verification
   - Password hash validation
   - Migration idempotency

### Limitations

- Only available in debug builds
- Limited to development and test environments
- Not suitable for production use
- Fixed set of predefined users
